# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository is a collection of implementations of popular data sturctures and algorithms in Python.

All the code has been written in Python 3.5.

This work draws heavily on the following sources:
  - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser
  - Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures by Brad Miller and David Ranum (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)
  
The repository was created to further elcuidate the programs outlined in the above sources for better understanding of the implementations and in some cases provide an alternative, more understandable versions of implementations provided in the above sources. Also included is the code to some coding problems.
