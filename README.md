# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository is a collection of implementations of popular data sturctures and algorithms in Python.

All the code has been written in Python 3.5.

This work drwas heavily on the follwoing sources:
  - Data Structures and Alagorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser
  - Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Strucutres by Brad Miller and David Ranum (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)
  
The repository was created to further elcuidate the programs outlined in the above sources for better understanding of the implementations. Also included is the code to some coding problems.
